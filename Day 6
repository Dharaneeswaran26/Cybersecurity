Cyber Security Terms(most important terms)
1. Policy(Set of rules)
2. Procedure(Step to follow the rules)
3. Standard(a Set of procedure)
4. Regulation(it is only given by Government)
  
Vulnerability Assessment (VA)
  process of identifying,quantifying,and prioritizing vulnerability within a system,network,application,or organizations
  it reviews the potential weakness which an attacker used to comprimise the CIA(confidentiality integrity availability)

VA process
Asset discovery---------->Vulnerability scanning----------->Vulnerability assessment ------------->Vulnerability remediation

Vulnerability Metrics (Vulnerability scores)
   National vulnerability databases - this websiter will tell us how to gives the rating or score(CVSS score)
   CVSS-Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Vulnerability Scanner(VS)
Types
1. Automated VS types
  1. Database VS
  2. Network VS
  3. Web Application VS
  4. Host-based VS
  5. API VS
  6. Cloud based VS
2. Manual VS


Vulnerability Assessment methods
1.VS
2.Penetration Testing
3.Risk Assessment 
4.Code reviews
5.Configuration Management
6.Patch management
7.Security assessment


Five phases of Hacking
1.Information gathering
2.Scanning(scan the information we gathered)
3.Gaining Access
4.Maintaining Access(persistence)
5.Clearing Tracks


Penetration Testing(an authorized attack on a device to identify security vulnerabilities that could be hacked)
process
Information Gathering------>Threat modeling------>Vulnerability analysis------->Exploitation ------>Post exploitation ----->Reporting
Types
1.Internal PT(there are some scope and rules to be followed)
2.External PT(they only give us the information and said to identify the vulnerability)


SAST- without deploying a code(
DAST- we use code (burpsuite)

OWASP Vulnerability
1.Sql Injection
2.Authentication vulnerability
3.Path Traversal/Directory Traversal
4.OS Command Injection
