intrusion --->unauthorised access to the data

firewall services:
packet services
statefull packet inspection and stateless packet inspection
proxy
network address translation
host based intrusion detection system (HIDS)
network based intrusion detection system (NIDS)
MDM (mobile device management)
end point protection ---> anti virus
